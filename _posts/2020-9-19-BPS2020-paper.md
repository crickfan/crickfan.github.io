## Research summary

**Backgroud & Aims**: Eating disorders are common in adolescence and are strongly comorbid with other psychiatric conditions. Yet, knowledge is limited on the aetiological mechanisms and their relationships with the comorbidites. This study aimed to identify neural and psychopathological predictors for the development of disordered eating behaviours and comorbid mental health problems in adolescence.

**Participants & Assessments**: Longitudinal assessments of disordered eating behaviuors (DEBs; binge-eating, purging and dieting) and comorbid symptoms (depression and generalized anxiety) were measured in 1,386 adolescents from the [IMAGEN](https://imagen-europe.com/) study. Participants took part in the study at ages 14, 16 and 19. Potential psychopathological predictors investigated were emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention symptoms and peer relationship problems, measured by the [Strengths and Difficulty Questionnaire](https://sdqinfo.org/). The neural predictors investigated here were the grey matter volumes of the brain, obtained from [Voxel-Based Morphometry](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-008045046-9.00306-5) analysis on MRI structural [neuroimaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging).

**Design & Analysis**: We defined developer groups for each of these symptoms involving participants who did not report symptoms at age 14 but developed symptoms at ages 16/19, and control groups who did not report symptoms at any of the three ages. We compared grey matter volumes and psychopathological differences at age 14 between the developers and controls to identify risk factors.

**Results**: DEBs and depressive symptoms developed together. Emotional and behavioural problems, including symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (CD), predated the development of both DEBs and depression. Alterations in fronto-striatal brain areas also predated the development of DEBs and depressive symptoms. Specifically, development of binge-eating at ages 16/19 was predicted by higher grey matter volumes in the right putamen/globus pallidus at age 14. On the other hand, development of purging and depressive symptoms was predicted by lower volumes in the medial orbitofrontal, dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, encompassing the brainâ€™s reward processing and inhibition control systems. Lower grey matter volumes in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices mediated the relationship between ADHD and CD symptoms at age 14 and the development of purging and depressive symptoms at later ages. 

**Conclusion**: These findings suggest that alterations in frontal brain circuits are part of the shared etiology between eating disorders, ADHD, CD and depression and highlight the importance of a transdiagnostic approach to treating these conditions.

My research paper "**Association of Genetic and Phenotypic Assessments With Onset of Disordered Eating Behaviors and Comorbid Mental Health Problems Among Adolescents**" has been published in JAMA Network Open in 2020.

## Research Key Points

**Question**  Do associations exist between disordered eating behaviors and other mental health disorders in adolescence, and if so, to what extent are those associations genetically predisposed?

**Findings**  Longitudinal assessments in this cohort study of a population-based sample of 1623 adolescents indicated that body mass index (BMI), neuroticism, impulse control, and addiction-related behaviors at 14 years of age were differentially associated with future disordered eating behaviors and symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety. Genetic analyses suggested etiologic overlaps between BMI, neuroticism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with dieting, binge eating, and purging, respectively.

**Meaning**  Genetic and phenotypic assessments of BMI, impulse control problems, and personality may inform early and differential diagnoses of eating disorders.
